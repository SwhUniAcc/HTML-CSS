<h2>Ingredients</h3>
<h3>Dough</h3>
<p1>F2¼ tsp (1 packet) active dry yeast - ¾ cup warm water (about 110°F / 43°C) - 2 cups all-purpose flour - 1 tsp sugar - 1 tsp salt - 1 tbsp olive oil</p1>
<h3>Sauce</h3>
<p1>1 tbsp olive oil - 2 cloves garlic, minced - 1 can (14 oz / 400g) crushed tomatoes - 1 tsp dried oregano - Salt and pepper to taste - Fresh basil leaves (optional)

<p1>8 oz (225g) fresh mozzarella, sliced - Fresh basil leaves - Olive oil for drizzling</p1>

<h3>Bake and Serve</h3>

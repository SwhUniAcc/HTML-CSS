<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Dough</h3>
<p1>In a bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for 5 – 10 minutes until frothy. Then, add flour, salt, and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.

<h3>Sauce</h3>
<p1>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat, Add garlic and sauté then wait for 30 seconds before adding anything else. Then, add crushed tomatoes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10 – 15 minutes. (Optionally, stir in a few torn basil leaves for extra flavor)
<h3>Assemble the Pizza</h3>

<h3>Bake and Serve</h3>
<p1>Bake for 12 – 15 minutes, or until crust is golden and cheese is bubbling. Let the pizza cool for a minute, slice, and enjoy your fresh, homemade pizza!</p1>

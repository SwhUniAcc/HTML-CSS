<h2 class="header-mid">The Classic Margherita Pizza</h2>
<p class="para-mid">The Classic Margherita Pizza is a simple yet iconic Italian dish made with a thin, crisp crust topped with rich tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and fragrant basil leaves. Drizzled with a touch of olive oil, it perfectly balances flavors of sweetness, creaminess, and freshness.</p>
